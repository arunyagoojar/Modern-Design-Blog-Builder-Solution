# Modern Design Blog Builder Using HTML/CSS/JS/JSON

This project is a solution for developers and technical people who have basic web development knowledge and want to create their own blog sites. The project provides an easy way to create a blog site by editing the JSON file and adding as many indexes as needed.

I have used this theme by [Taylon, Chan](https://codepen.io/tin-fung-hk) :  [theme](https://codepen.io/tin-fung-hk/pen/rNpEPpM)

## How to Use?

To use this project, you need to edit the JSON file provided. You can add as many indexes as you want and customize the content for each index. The project structure is designed to be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Editing Criteria

The editing rules for the JSON content will soon be published. The basic structure for the paragraphs and headings has already been created, making it easy to add and organize your content.

## Example Site

An example of the site can be seen [here](https://arunyagoojar.me/blog/index.html). This will give you an idea of what the final product might look like once you have edited the JSON file to include your own content.
